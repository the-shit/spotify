## Here It Is

A Spotify control component for THE SHIT (Scaling Humans Into Tomorrow). Command-line music control that keeps you in your flow. No context switching, no distractions, just pure control over your soundtrack.

## The Essentials

- **Playback Control** - Play, pause, skip, previous. Direct and immediate.
- **Smart Search** - Find tracks, artists, albums, playlists instantly
- **Queue Management** - See what's coming, add what should be next
- **Device Switching** - Control any device from your terminal
- **Now Playing** - Current track info without leaving your workspace
- **Persistent Auth** - Authenticate once, control indefinitely
